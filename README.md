# mi

`mi` is a command-line interface tool designed to interact with the Gemini API for generating content based on user-defined tasks. It executes custom Ruby logic via mruby, which is embedded directly within a statically compiled binary. This approach allows tasks to be dynamically loaded from user configuration scripts, providing flexibility without requiring an external Ruby installation.

## Overview

The `mi` tool functions by taking a specified task name, locating and loading the corresponding Ruby script from the user's configuration directory. This script defines the prompt and schema for the initial interaction with the Gemini API. `mi` sends the user input (or lack thereof) through the task's defined prompt, retrieves a draft answer from the API, and then performs a second API call to evaluate the draft answer for factual correctness and relevance. The final output is a structured JSON object containing the evaluated answer and scores.

## Key Features

*   **Task-Based Generation:** Generates content based on modular, user-defined tasks.
*   **Dynamic Task Loading:** Automatically discovers and loads task definitions from Ruby scripts located in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mi/tasks/`.
*   **Embedded mruby Execution:** Runs task logic written in Ruby using an embedded mruby interpreter, resulting in a self-contained, statically compiled binary.
*   **Gemini API Integration:** Interacts with the Google Gemini API using task-defined prompts and schemas.
*   **Two-Phase Evaluation:** Implements a built-in second API call to evaluate the initial generated content for confidence and fit score.
*   **Customizable Prompts & Schemas:** Tasks define the specific text prompt and expected response schema for the first API call.
*   **Task Listing:** Includes a command to list all available tasks discovered in the configuration directory.

## Installation / Usage

### ‚úÖ Recommended: Download Prebuilt Binary

1.  Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/hoshinotsuyoshi/mi/releases).
2.  Download the appropriate binary for your operating system and architecture.
3.  Make the binary executable:

    ```sh
    chmod +x ./mi
    ```

4.  (Optional) Move the binary to a directory included in your system's `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin/`:

    ```sh
    mv ./mi /usr/local/bin/
    ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Alternative: Build from Source

1.  Ensure you have a C compiler (like `clang`) and GNU `make` installed.
2.  Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/hoshinotsuyoshi/mi.git
    cd mi
    ```

3.  Build the binary:

    ```sh
    make
    ```

    This process compiles mruby, the core Ruby logic into bytecode, and links everything into a single `mi` executable.

### üîß Setup & Run

1.  Obtain a Gemini API key and set it as the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable:

    ```sh
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```

2.  List available tasks:

    ```sh
    mi list
    ```

    This command searches `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mi/tasks/` for task definitions (directories containing `main.rb`). Tasks in subdirectories (e.g., `category/task_name`) are listed with their full path.

3.  Run a task:

    ```sh
    mi run <task_name>
    ```

    *   `<task_name>` corresponds to the name of a directory (or path within subdirectories) under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mi/tasks/` that contains a `main.rb` script.
    *   By default, the tool reads input from stdin. Use the `--no-stdin` flag if the task does not require external input.
    *   If stdin is provided as a JSON object containing `confidence` and `fit_score` keys, the tool will exit with an error if either value is less than 0.8. Otherwise, the raw input is passed to the task's `text` method.

4.  Output:

    The tool outputs a JSON object to stdout representing the evaluated result from the Gemini API:

    ```json
    {
      "main": "The generated and evaluated content.",
      "confidence": 0.95,  // Self-assessed factual correctness (0-1)
      "fit_score": 0.90     // Relevance and completeness w.r.t. question (0-1)
    }
    ```

## Task Customization

Tasks are defined by Ruby scripts located in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mi/tasks/<task_name>/main.rb`. Each `main.rb` file must define a class that provides the core logic for interacting with the Gemini API.

The class within the script must implement the following methods:

*   `text(input)`: This method receives the input read from stdin (if any) as a string. It should return the final text prompt string that will be sent to the Gemini API in the first call.
*   `response_schema`: This method must return a JSON schema object defining the expected structure of the response from the *first* Gemini API call.
*   `(Optional) model`: This method can return a string specifying the desired Gemini model to use for this task, overriding the default (`gemini-2.0-flash-lite`). The model must be one of the internally supported options.

### Example Task Definition (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mi/tasks/summarize_article/main.rb`)

```ruby
Class.new(Mi) do
  # Defines the prompt sent to the Gemini API.
  # 'input' contains the text read from stdin.
  def text(input)
    "Summarize the following article concisely:

#{input}"
  end

  # Defines the expected structure of the API response.
  # Used for schema validation in the first call and building the evaluation prompt.
  def response_schema
    {
      "type": "STRING"
    }
  end

  # (Optional) Specify a different model for this task.
  # def model
  #   "gemini-2.0-flash"
  # end
end
```

## Requirements / Dependencies

*   A Unix-like operating system (macOS, Linux, etc.)
*   A C compiler (like `clang`)
*   GNU `make`
*   `curl` command-line tool
*   A valid Gemini API key (set as the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable)
