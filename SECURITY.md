## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please contact me directly via DM on X (formerly Twitter): [@hoppiestar](https://x.com/hoppiestar)

Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

You can expect an initial response within a few days. I will evaluate all reports and take appropriate action as necessary. If the report is valid and actionable, I will work to fix the issue promptly and credit you if desired.
